dfuse - dynamic menu and commandline interface
====================
dfuse is an efficient dynamic menu for X i based on dmenu that can also function as an commandline interface.


Requirements
------------
Just like dmenu, In order to build dfuse you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dfuse
-------------
See the man page for details.
additions made to this are:
- run teminal applications by prepending them with dterm
	- for [sudo] commands that you don't need an output also append them with a ;
- anything not appended with a ; will send it's stdout and stderr to another dmenu for easy viewing, usefull for journalctli, service openvpn status, cat, ls, man and friends

Current limitations
-------------------
- cd only work in combination with vim or other commandline tools
- only single line commands work
- no file name completion
- limited commandline completion
