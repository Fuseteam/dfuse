dfuse - dynamic menu and commandline interface
====================
dfuse is an efficient dynamic menu for X i based on dmenu that can also function as an commandline interface.


Requirements
------------
Just like dmenu, In order to build dfuse you need the Xlib header files.
for networkmanager integration libnm-util-dev and gir1.2-nm-1.0 are needed on ubuntu/debian. see the full list of requirements for network manager integration at [the networkmanager-dmenu repo](https://github.com/firecat53/networkmanager-dmenu#requirements)

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dfuse
-------------
See the man page for details.
additions made to this are:
- run teminal applications and commands that have uninteresting outputs by prepending them with dterm
- by prepending commands with dout you can send it's stdout and stderr to another dmenu for easy viewing, usefull for journalctli, service openvpn status, cat, ls, man and friends

Current limitations
-------------------
- cd only work in combination with vim or other commandline tools
- only single line commands work
- no file name completion
- limited commandline completion
